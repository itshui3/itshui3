### hi I'm hui.

I started writing the codes in 2019, now I write better codes. 

I like working on cool projects. It's fun to bring ideas to life in a team, but being able to implement on my own is liberating. 

My current goals are to work better with others and to feel confident that if I have an idea, I can build it.
