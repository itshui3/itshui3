### hi I'm hui.

I started writing the codes in 2019, now I write better codes. 

I like working on cool projects. It's fun to work towards a common goal in a team, while being able to make stuff on my own is liberating. 

My current goal is to feel confident that if I have an idea, I can build it. (and to find yob)
